# Switch-guild-tags

This is the code to switch guild tags and you have to join those guild tags too.

💀💀
I'm still not sure if using this will get you banned by Discord or not, especially since the Guild Tags feature just launched recently. Plus, the script sends requests to Discord's servers really frequently – like every 3 seconds. So please be careful if you use it.
Using this script causes the Discord desktop client and the Discord mobile app to become very laggy. This might be because we are making too many API requests.

This server has everything included.
